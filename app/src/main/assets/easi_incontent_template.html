<p>No! Don't jump! Meh. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</p>
<p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Oh yeah, good luck with that. I just told you! You've killed me! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
<p>Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Daylight and everything. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
<p>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? You're going to do his laundry? A true inspiration for the children. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</p>
<p>So, how 'bout them Knicks? Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
<p>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
<p>Actually, that's still true. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? With gusto.</p>
<p>Shut up and get to the point! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
<p>Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. How much did you make me? Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>

<p>Steve Holt! Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Really? Did nothing cancel? No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.</p>
<p>Marry me. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
<p>Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. Michael! As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.</p>
<p>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Guy's a pro. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
<p>He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Really? Did nothing cancel? First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Guy's a pro. I care deeply for nature.</p>
<p>That's why you always leave a note! No… but I'd like to be asked! No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
<p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' We just call it a sausage. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'</p>
<p>That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Steve Holt! We just call it a sausage.</p>
<p>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? I'm half machine. I'm a monster.</p>
<p>Guy's a pro. Guy's a pro. Whoa, this guy's straight? Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.</p>

<p>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
<p>I just told you! You've killed me! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I don't want to be rescued. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>
<p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</p>
<p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? And until then, I can never die? No! The cat shelter's on to me. You know, I was God once. Leela's gonna kill me.</p>
<p>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Leela's gonna kill me. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! They're like sex, except I'm having them!</p>
<p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</p>
<p>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. I just told you! You've killed me!</p>
<p>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. No! The cat shelter's on to me.</p>
<p>Really?! Oh yeah, good luck with that. Say it in Russian! I don't want to be rescued. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</p>
<p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</p>
